# very-slow-movie-player
Inspired by Bryan Boyer https://medium.com/s/story/very-slow-movie-player-499f76c48b62 the very slow movie player plays a film on an e-ink display at 24 frames per hour

For this project I used a 7.5in waveform e-ink display and a raspberry pi. 
I used the ffmpeg-python library to grab frames in order and the Python Image Library to convert the frames for the e-ink display.
I put the display in a picture frame and built a little shelf for it to sit on.
